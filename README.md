## About The Project
This project is all about fractals.  Here you can find examples of them drawn using P5.js.

## Set up
One way you can view the shapes is by using the p5 web editor [here](https://editor.p5js.org/FadoBagy/sketches/8dgrafqAr). Or you can download [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode) Visual Studio Code extension and run the code there.

## Usage
–êt the bottom, under the drawing, there is a slider that can be used to change the *maximum number of iterations* applied to make the fractal.

Or you can use the links below to directly access my p5.js projects.
